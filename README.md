This repository documents a 90-day Full-Stack + AI learning journey based on a structured, mentor-style roadmap: HTML/CSS/JS → React → FastAPI backend → AI integration → projects and job prep.
​

Project overview
Personal learning journal to become a Full-Stack Developer with AI in ~90 days, starting from zero React/full-stack experience.
​

Daily, hands-on tasks: build small projects, avoid copy–paste, and focus on logic, debugging, and clean structure.

Goal outcome: 3–4 portfolio projects (React + FastAPI + AI), deployed apps, and interview readiness.

Repository structure
day01-html-css-js/ – first HTML/CSS/JS page, input + button + basic validation.

day02-.../ – layout and Flexbox practice (to be added as journey progresses).
​

react-projects/ – React mini apps: counters, to-do, notes, and chat UI.

backend-fastapi/ – FastAPI APIs, auth, and database experiments.

ai-projects/ – AI chat, file Q&A, and other LLM-based tools inspired by full-stack AI roadmaps.
​

90-day roadmap (high level)
Month 1 – Web + React foundations: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React basics, Router, Tailwind, and a ChatGPT-like UI.

Month 2 – Backend + database: FastAPI, REST, auth with JWT, SQLite/PostgreSQL, and full-stack integration.

Month 3 – AI and projects: LLM APIs, prompt engineering, AI chat backend, file Q&A app, Docker, logging, and job prep.
​

Day-by-day tracking
Each day has its own folder with:

README.md describing what was learned, what was built, and next steps.
​

Source files (HTML/JS/React/Python) showing progression from simple DOM logic to full-stack + AI features.

Commit messages like Day 1: basic HTML structure and JS interaction to show consistent growth over time.
​

How to use this repo
Browse folders by day/week to see the learning progression and code evolution.

Use the structure as a template for your own full-stack + AI learning journal on GitHub.
​

Recruiters/mentors can review daily checkpoints to understand skills, discipline, and problem-solving approach.
